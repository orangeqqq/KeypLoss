# tspDice and TSP-Warp-X Loss
Official repository for “TSP-Warp-X: A Novel Topological Shape Point Metric Warping Loss for Fully-Supervised and Weakly-Supervised Vessel Segmentation”.

The precise and reliable quantitative analysis and visualization of tubular structures, such as bronchioles, nerve fibers, and blood vessels, demand accurate automated segmentation from medical imaging data. Existing methodologies suffer from a deficiency in either a tailored design to preserve key shape structures or an adequate metric for assessing the precision of these structures. For instance, existing volume and topology metrics fall short in accurately evaluating vessel shapes. This motivates us to develop a topological shape metric to evaluate both shape structures and topology. Subsequently, the metric is expanded into a series of losses aimed at preserving topological shape structures.
